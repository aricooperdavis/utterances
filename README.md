# aricooperdavis/utterances

This repository is used by [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) to store comments for my website: [cooper-davis.net](https://cooper-davis.net).

The idea is that a new GitHub Issue is opened for every page, and the comments on that issue are used as the comments on the page content. To the end user this creates a pretty seamless comments system (with the slightly unusual quirk of having to authenticate using your GitHub account).

I like this idea, in no small part, because it's free.
